; XINT interrupts in assembly. These are tweaked for the shortest possible 
; response time. Both of them toggle GPIO19. These only save a couple cycles vs.
; their C equivalents.

	.global _XINT_ASM_ISR_FLASH

	;This copy of the function runs out of RAM with zero wait states. The delay
    ;from GPIO16 going low to GPIO19 going high was measured as 
    ;125 nanoseconds, which is 25 cycles at 200 MHz.

	MOV @7h, #0008h       ;Set bit 19 of GPATOGGLE (address 0x7f06)
	MOVZ DP, #0cc0h >> 6  ;Load DP with a value close to the PIEACK address (0xcc0).
	                      ;We can't use the PIE base address of 0xce0 because the
	                      ;0x20 bit gets dropped during the right-shift.
	MOV @21h, #0001h      ;Write to PIEACK to re-enable the interrupt group
	NASP                  ;Unalign stack pointer. Again, this is only here for realism.

	;This copy of the function runs out of flash with three wait states. It's 
    ;aligned to an 8-word (128-bit) boundary so that the first several 
    ;instructions will be in a single flash word. The delay from GPIO16 going 
    ;low to GPIO19 going high was measured as 135 nanoseconds, which is 
    ;27 cycles at 200 MHz.
